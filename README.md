Immersive LED Backlight System
This project creates an immersive LED backlight system for your TV or monitor using a Raspberry Pi, a video capture card, and WS281x LED strips. The LED strips dynamically change colors based on the content displayed on the screen, providing a more immersive viewing experience.

Parts Needed
Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient processing power, e.g., Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4)
WS281x LED Strips (ensure the length and number of LEDs fit your screen size)
4K USB 3.0 HDMI Video Capture Card
AC Power Adapter (suitable for powering both the Raspberry Pi and the LED strips, if necessary)
HDMI Cables (for connecting your video source to the capture card and the capture card to the display)
USB Cables (for connecting the video capture card to the Raspberry Pi)
Jumper Wires and Connectors (for connecting the LED strips to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins)
Optional: Enclosure for the Raspberry Pi and other components
Software Requirements
Raspbian OS installed on the Raspberry Pi
Python 3 and pip (Python package installer)
OpenCV library for video processing
rpi_ws281x library for controlling WS281x LED strips
RPi.GPIO library for GPIO pin control
Setup Instructions
1. Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
Install Raspbian OS: Follow the official Raspberry Pi installation guide to install Raspbian OS.
Update System:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
2. Install Necessary Software
Install Python and Pip:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
Install OpenCV:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python3-opencv
Install RPi.GPIO:

bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO
Install rpi_ws281x:

bash
Copy code
sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x
3. Hardware Connections
Connect Video Capture Card:

HDMI input from the source (e.g., TV or computer).
USB output to the Raspberry Pi.
Connect LED Strips:

Connect the data line of the LED strip to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., GPIO 18).
Connect the power (5V) and ground lines of the LED strip to an appropriate power source.
